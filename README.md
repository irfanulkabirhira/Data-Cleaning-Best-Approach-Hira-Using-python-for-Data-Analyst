This repository showcases a step-by-step, real-world data cleaning workflow using Python — designed specifically for Data Analysts, not for Machine Learning or Deep Learning tasks.

✅ Cleaning Workflow Covered:

  Removing unnecessary columns – Drop columns that are irrelevant or redundant.

   Renaming columns – Rename headers for clarity and consistency.

   Removing duplicate rows – Ensure unique records in the dataset.

  Merging columns – Combine related columns into a single meaningful field.

  Splitting columns – Break down complex columns into simpler parts (e.g., names, dates).

  Replacing null values – Handle missing data using suitable techniques.

   Changing data types – Convert columns to proper data types (e.g., string to datetime).

   Sorting columns – Organize data based on specific columns for better readability.

   Filtering the dataset – Keep only the relevant subset of data for analysis.


   📁 Repository Structure:

   notebooks/: Jupyter Notebooks with examples

   scripts/: Python files with reusable functions

   data/: Sample datasets for demonstration

This project is perfect for students, junior analysts, or anyone who wants a clean, practical foundation in data preparation using Python.
